Project Title: Rubik's Cube

Team: David Skrundz, Ryan Huard

Description:
	Simulate an interactive Rubik's Cube

Milestones:
 - Create a 3x3x3 Rubik's Cube that can be manipulated
 - Allow the user to manipulate the Rubik's Cube directly
 - Randomize the Rubik's Cube at the beginning in a way that still makes it solvable
 - Add a check for a win condition and a timer/move counter
 - Add a solver that can solve arbitrary 3x3x3 Rubik's Cubes while presenting the moves required to the user
 - [If time permits] Improve the user interface and the user experience by rendering the Rubik's Cube in 3D, and improving the control scheme.
 - [If time permits] Extend the program to make NxNxN Cubes for any N. Also optimize the calculation (for rotation) if needed
